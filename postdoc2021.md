**Postdoctoral Scholar in Nuclear Astrophysics or Near-Field Cosmology**

The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of
Chicago invites applications for a postdoctoral scholar to work with
<a href="https://www.alexji.com/">Dr. Alexander Ji</a> on topics related to nuclear astrophysics or near
field cosmology. Preference will be given to researchers interested in
connecting massive star nucleosynthesis (core-collapse supernovae,
neutron star mergers) to stellar abundance observations.
Researchers working on related topics in metal-poor stellar
evolution, stellar spectroscopy, nearby dwarf galaxies, and the
Milky Way stellar halo will also be considered.

The appointment is expected to begin in Fall 2021 (negotiable) for two
years, with a likely extension for a third year based on
performance. Applicants should have completed a PhD in Astrophysics or
related disciplines before the appointment begins. The successful
applicant will have access to the Magellan telescopes and SDSS-V.

To apply: email a cover letter, CV, publication list, and statement of
research interests and experience as a single PDF file to
nearfieldcosmology@gmail.com by Dec 18, 2020. Please also arrange for
3 letters of recommendation to be sent to the same email.

We seek a diverse pool of applicants who wish to join an academic
community that places the highest value on rigorous inquiry and
encourages a diversity of perspectives, experiences, groups of
individuals, and ideas to inform and stimulate intellectual challenge,
engagement, and exchange.
