### Interested in Near Field Cosmology at University of Chicago?

* Prospective graduate students: Apply to the UChicago [PhD Program](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/) and include my name in your application. However, I do not expect to take any graduate students until at least 2026.
* Current UChicago graduate students: send me an e-mail with your resume/CV and a description of research interests.
* Current UChicago undergraduate students: in 2024-2025, I expect to only take students through the Astro Field Course.
* Undergraduates outside UChicago: I am currently only accepting external undergraduate students through the [UChicago Leadership Alliance](https://leadershipalliance.uchicago.edu/).
* High school students: I do not take high school students in my research group.
* Postdoctoral fellowships and positions: If you would like to come to UChicago through a national or UChicago fellowship, please e-mail me and let me know! The primary local fellowships at UChicago are the [Margaret Burbidge Fellowship](https://astro-fellowship.uchicago.edu/) and the [KICP Fellowship](https://kicp-fellowship.uchicago.edu/). The primary national fellowships are the [NSF AAPF](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nsf-astronomy-astrophysics-postdoctoral), [NHFP Hubble Fellowship](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program), and the [Brinson Prize Fellowship](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/brinson-prize-fellowship-program/announcement-of-opportunity). A list of other opportunities is here: [https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/research/prize-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-astronomy-and-astrophysics/](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/research/prize-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-astronomy-and-astrophysics/). If you are interested in connections between astronomy and artificial intelligence, consider applying to the [SkAI Institute](https://skai-institute.org/index.html).
