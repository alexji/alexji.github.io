### Interested in Near Field Cosmology at University of Chicago?

* Current UChicago undergraduates or graduate students: send me an e-mail with a description of your resume/CV and research interests.
* Prospective graduate students: apply to the UChicago [PhD Program](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/) and include my name in your application.
* Postdoctoral fellowships and positions: e-mail me if you are interested in listing UChicago as a host institution for your fellowship applications or applying for one of our KICP fellowship positions. I do not have open postdoctoral positions right now.

### People 2020-2021
In the COVID-19 summer of 2020, a group of undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc (me) convened weekly to work together on projects related to near-field cosmology and stellar spectroscopy. Here is a photo from one of our Zoom meetings.

We have continued meeting in the year of 2020-2021, and [Kaley Brauer](http://www.mit.edu/~kbrauer/) wrote an excellent April Fools paper on our progress: ["I'll Finish It This Week" And Other Liest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16574)
