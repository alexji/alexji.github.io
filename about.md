![Alex Ji](/img/alexji.jpg)

I am currently a Carnegie Fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/).
From 2017-2020 I was a [Hubble Fellow](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/smo/fellowships/hubble), also at Carnegie.
I graduated in 2017 with a PhD in Physics from the Astrophysics division at MIT, advised by [Anna Frebel](http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/frebel_anna.html).
In 2020, I will move to the University of Chicago as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/).

I grew up in the California Bay Area where I spent most of my time doing math and playing piano. 
I graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a Physics BS (minor in CS) and in 2012 with a Statistics MS, specializing in applied statistics and learning methods.
I really enjoy teaching, and at Stanford I taught many courses, including the first generation of the student initiated course [Practical Computing for Scientists](https://web.stanford.edu/class/physics91SI/). 
I also sang and played piano for [Side by Side](http://sidebyside.stanford.edu/), and presided over the Stanford SPS.
More recently, I have participated in the [PDP program by UCSC-ISEE](https://isee.ucsc.edu/programs/pdp/index.html).
In my spare time, I enjoy eating food, board games, hiking, and classical music.
