![Alex Ji](/img/alexji2.jpg)

I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago in the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/).
From 2017-2021 I was a [Hubble Fellow](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/smo/fellowships/hubble) and Carnegie Fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/).
I graduated in 2017 with a PhD in Physics from the Astrophysics division at MIT, advised by [Anna Frebel](http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/frebel_anna.html).
I graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a Physics BS (minor in CS) and in 2012 with a Statistics MS, specializing in applied statistics and learning methods.

I grew up in the California Bay Area where I spent most of my time doing math and playing piano. 
This continued in college as I sang and played piano for [Side by Side](http://sidebyside.stanford.edu/).
These days in my spare time, I enjoy making and eating food, board games, podcasts, wandering near the lake, classical music, and Taylor Swift.
