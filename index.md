Welcome! I am a Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/). I use Near Field Cosmology to study the first stars and galaxies.
In 2021, I will move to the University of Chicago as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/).

I am currently hiring a postdoctoral scholar in nuclear astrophysics or near-field cosmology.
Graduate students applying to University of Chicago in 2021 interested in near-field cosmology or stellar spectroscopy should contact me. The GRE is not accepted this application cycle. Fee waivers are [available](https://www.btaa.org/resources-for/students/freeapp/introduction).
