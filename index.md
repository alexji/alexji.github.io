Welcome! I am a Hubble Fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/). I use Near Field Cosmology to study the first stars and galaxies.
In 2021, I will move to the University of Chicago as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/).
