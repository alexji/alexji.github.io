Welcome! I am a Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/). I use Near Field Cosmology to study the first stars and galaxies.
In 2021, I will move to the University of Chicago as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/).

### Research Opportunities Starting in 2021

* I am currently hiring a [postdoctoral scholar in nuclear astrophysics or near-field cosmology](postdoc2021), applications due Dec 18, 2020.

* The Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics has a new prize fellowship in observational astrophysics: [Brinson Fellowship](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/c72d4595)

* Graduate students applying to [University of Chicago Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/) in 2021 interested in near-field cosmology or stellar spectroscopy should contact me. Advice on how to apply is [at this link](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/how-to-apply/). The GRE is not accepted this application cycle. Fee waivers are [available](https://www.btaa.org/resources-for/students/freeapp/introduction).
