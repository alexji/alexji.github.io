I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. I use Near Field Cosmology to study the first stars and galaxies.

Feb 2025: I have been awarded a [Sloan Research Fellowship](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2025-Fellows) and [LSST Scialog Award](https://rescorp.org/news/2025/02/8-teams-win-awards-in-1st-year-of-scialog-early-science-with-the-lsst).

Jan 2024: we have discovered a star of spectacular chemical composition in SDSS-V! See [Outreach/News](https://www.alexji.com/outreach/) for more information.
