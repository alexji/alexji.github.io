# An extended halo around an ancient dwarf galaxy
[Anirudh Chiti](http://www.mit.edu/~achiti/) led a paper detecting the very outskirts of the dwarf galaxy Tucana II.
This is the furthest out that stars have been detected around a tiny galaxy. The paper is published in [Nature Astronomy](https://rdcu.be/ceAbh).

# A primitive stellar stream

The [S5 survey](https://s5collab.github.io/) has discovered the most metal-poor known globular cluster in the Milky Way.
It is being actively tidally shredded by the Milky Way.
