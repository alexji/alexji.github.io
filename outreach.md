# Spectacular Nucleosynthesis in Early Massive Stars
We recently published a discovery of a star with spectacular chemical composition, discovered in [SDSS-V](https://sdss.org/).
It implies an explosion of an ancient star so massive that it should not have exploded, but we are at the limits of our theoretical supernova models.
The [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...961L..41J/abstract) is out and you can see my AAS press conference on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/XCd662aOmy4?si=BtsCACfPFL2gsvDP&t=1972).

# Twelve for Dinner
The [S5 collaboration](https://s5collab.github.io/) published the first 6D map of twelve distant stellar streams ([paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211006950L)) that will help reveal the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. Press from [UToronto](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dozen_stellar_stream/), see details at [our website](https://s5collab.github.io/one_dozen_streams_press_release/).

# An extended halo around an ancient dwarf galaxy
[Anirudh Chiti](http://www.mit.edu/~achiti/) led a paper detecting the very outskirts of the dwarf galaxy Tucana II.
This is the furthest out that stars have been detected around a tiny galaxy. The paper is published in [Nature Astronomy](https://rdcu.be/ceAbh).

# A primitive stellar stream

The [S5 survey](https://s5collab.github.io/) has discovered the most metal-poor known globular cluster in the Milky Way.
It is being actively tidally shredded by the Milky Way.
